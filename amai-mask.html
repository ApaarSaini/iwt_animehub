            <p>Handsome Kamen Amai Mask (イケメン仮面アマイマスク, Ikemen Kamen Amai Masuku, Handsomely Masked Sweet Mask) is a beautiful model, singer, and actor, and the top superhero by popularity for over 28 weeks. He is very narcissistic, having a philosophy that heroes should be "tough, strong, and beautiful as well as be able to promptly and splendidly eradicate evil."Web ch. 28, Ch. 25 He is also part of the promotion process for any rank 1 heroes who want to advance to the next class, although he mostly cares about those entering A-class or above.Ch. 29 Despite his charismatic exterior, he has a strong hatred for anything deemed evil (including those whom he consider its accomplice), and is rather merciless, executing Boros's captured subordinates on the crash-landed alien ship, even planning to kill the brainwashed victims.Ch. 37, 103 He chooses to remain at A-Class, rank 1, so as to prevent other A-Class members from applying to be S-Class without his blessing as mentioned by Hellish Blizzard when she mentions how Atomic Samurai's disciples can't join their master in S-Class. Unbeknownst to everyone, Amai Mask is secretly not entirely a human, as seen when his eye stabbed on one of the Monster Association member and his entire face revealed to be as thick as a hard material that can be broken, and never bleeds, while quickly regenerate, indicating there is something inhuman about him, even Atomic Samurai's disciples begin to be suspicious about Amai Mask's true nature since witnessing him execute surviving Dark Matter Thieves in cold blood.Ch. 103 At one point in his life, Amai Mask was saved by Blast as Amai Mask considered him his idol.

            <hr>
            <p>Sweet Mask is a tall and lean-built young man with messy shoulder-length light blue hair that has a single hair strand hanging down in the middle of his face and yellow eyes. He is considered to be very handsome by the public.</p>
            <p>He wears a white jacket over his gray shirt with a green circle necklace and black trousers.</p>
            <p>During the invasion of the Seafolk, he was sporting a shorter hairstyle with his hair parted to the right. He is seen with long hair again when he addresses the Hero Association official and, in his most recent appearance, he is again shown with his short hair. Interestingly, Sweet Mask's eyes seem to turn from a yellow into a blood-red when extremely angered.</p>

            <p><b>Expert Hand-to-Hand Combatant:</b> Sweet Mask is a very skilled fighter. During his fight against Suppon, he first moves in the latter's blind spot, incapacitates him, and then delivers a lethal strike.[37] Combining with his superhuman strength and speed, Sweet Mask's hands act as a sharp blade that he usually uses to slice monsters in half.
