He is part of a group called the Holy Order Of The Sword, along with Nichirin, Amahare, and Zanbai, each an exceptionally skilled sword-wielder.Ch. 68 After the deaths of previous swordsmen trios at the hands of a toxic form of a monster Fuhrer Ugly, Kamikaze is entrusted by a dying Nichirin with one of the two Sacred Blades, the Sun Blade, and becoming a new leader of the order, with a mission to search Moon Blade, once the war against Monster Association is over.

            <p><b>Master Swordsman:</b> Atomic Samurai is an extremely formidable swordsman, so much so that he is considered to be the Earth's strongest swordsman. Legend even says that he can cut down over 100 enemies with each strike.[2] His sword attacks are so fast and strong that the enemies are slashed into many pieces in an instant without even being able to react. He was also able to cut a monster to bits using a mere toothpick.[13] Additionally, Atomic Samurai was able to partially cut off Black Sperm's body without causing the monster to duplicate using the blunted edge of his sword, while also pummeling him to death.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p><b>Atomic Slash</b> (アトミック斬, Atomikku Zan): Atomic Samurai's signature attack. He performs over 100 quick sword slashes within a second, leaving his opponents in pieces.[2] He primarily uses this technique while dashing past the opponent, but has also shown a stationary version in which he slashes everything around himself. Kamikaze is the only swordsman in the world capable of performing this technique.</p>

              <li><p><b>Air Blade</b> (飛空剣, Hikūken; Viz: Flying Sword): Kamikaze slashes with his sword and sends a blade of compressed air at his opponents. He can perform the attack upon drawing his sword, blocking an attack and finishing with the air blade in one motion.[18] He taught this technique to Okamaitachi.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Atomic Beeline Slash</b> (アトミック一文字斬, Atomikku Ichimonji Zan; Viz: Atomic Straight Slash): Kamikaze performs a single and powerful slash in an overhead strike, slicing his opponent. It was first used against the fusion of Psykos and Orochi.</p></li>
