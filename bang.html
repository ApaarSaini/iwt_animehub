            <p>Bang (バング, Bangu), who goes by the hero name Silverfang (シルバーファング, Shirubā Fangu, anime: Silver Fang), at rank 3, is an expert martial artist who runs a dojo in City Z.Web ch. 20, Ch. 21 Back when he was young, Bang use to utilize a forbidden martial arts style "Fist of Unleashed Explosive" (爆心解放拳, Bakushin Kaihō-ken) for his selfishness until his brother, Bomb redeems him. Inspired by his brother's fighting style, Bang abandoned the forbidden style he used and invent "Fist of Flowing Water Crushing Rock" (流水岩砕拳, Ryūsui Gaisai-ken) with a similar caliber as the style Bomb uses, and joins Hero Association in the present prior to Saitama's registration to the organization. Thanks to Bomb, Bang becomes wise and displays a great deal of patience when compared to others in S-class and often scolds other heroes for being haughty or selfish, just he was back in his youth.Ch. 150 His sole student is Charanko as he had a former disciple named Garo who beat down his other students including Sourface until they quit, and Bang was too late to stop Garo from learning a forbidden knowledge of Bang's former fighting style. The incident of Garo walking a similar path as Bang had is a painful memory for the latter and as a result, he constantly looks for new disciples to pass on his martial arts; Charanko is fairly incompetent, after all.Vol. 6 He is one of the first heroes to recognize Saitama's true power, witnessing him destroying a meteor on its way to wipe out Z-City.

            <p><b>Master Martial Artist:</b> From decades of experience and training, Bang is one of the most powerful martial artists in the world. Bang possesses a vast knowledge of martial arts and, as a result, was able to create his own martial art. He is considered to be the "Greatest Treasure of Martial Arts".[40] His <b>Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist</b> is much more efficient and precise than Garou’s, as Darkshine himself made the comparison after fighting the Hero Hunter, stating that compared to Bang, his technique was still far from perfect.[41] Garou must make a conscious effort in order to use the techniques, but for Bang, it has become part of his very being.[42] His mastery of martial arts was also displayed in a sparring match against a fellow S-Class hero, Superalloy Darkshine, whom Bang was able to avoid and deflect all attacks from,[19] as well as during his clash against Fuhrer Ugly and Gums, two powerful Dragon-level threats, in which Bang was capable of skillfully deflecting all attacks from the former and redirecting them at either itself or towards Gums.[43] During his fight with an evolved Garou, despite the latter having drastically improved his combat skills through many battles, Bang was still capable of fighting him on equal footing for a noticeable amount of time.

              <li><b>Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist</b> (流水岩砕拳, Ryūsui Gansai-ken; Viz: Fist of Flowing Water, Crushed Rock): A martial art developed by Bang himself after many years of training, and is said to be the ultimate defensive art.[47] Genos describes the style as "the perfect blend of offense and defense".[48] Charanko describes Bang, or at least his usage of the martial art, as "leading his enemies around the nose by moving like a calm stream, only to finish them off with a punch strong enough to smash great rocks like a raging river"[49], implying that Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist parallels real-life Tai Chi.

              </li>
              <li>Exploding Heart Release Fist (爆心解放拳, Bakushin Kaihō-ken; Viz: Fist of Exploding Heart, Liberation‎): Bang's primary martial art before developing Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist.[55] Unlike his current fighting style, the Exploding Heart Release Fist focuses more on offensive and destructive power. After being defeated by Bomb, Bang abandoned this fighting style, locking the scrolls inscribed with the secret techniques in a safe and developing the Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist instead. Bang does not like using this martial art anymore due to it reminding him of his past self, as he refused to resort to it during his fight with an evolved Garou, even when being forced into a corner

              </li>
              <li>Whirlwind Water Stream: Roaring Aura Sky Ripping Fist (旋風流水 轟気空裂拳, Senpū Ryūsui: Gōki Kūretsu-ken; Viz: Whirling Wind Flowing Water: Fist of Roaring Qi, Rending Air): An advanced technique that combines both Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist and Whirlwind Iron Cutting Fist. To perform the technique, Bang and Bomb stand side-by-side and assume strong stances. Both perform their respective martial arts and strike their opponent simultaneously, sending powerful shockwaves through their body. The technique was powerful enough to knock back a charging Elder Centipede and shatter the monster's carapace. However, it is stated by Bang that they can only do this technique once per battle since both of them have passed their prime.[25] Traditionally when the technique connects, the shock-waves created will spread through the enemy's entire body, which ultimately reduces them to dust.</li>
              <li>Whirlwind Water Stream: Cross Fang Dragon Slayer Fist (旋風流水 交牙竜殺拳, Senpū Ryūsui: Kōga Ryūsatsu-ken; Viz: Whirling Wind Flowing Water: Fist of Biting Fangs, Killing Dragons): A combination of Bang and Bomb's martial arts, even more powerful than Whirlwind Water Stream: Roaring Aura Sky Ripping Fist.[42] Together, Bang and Bomb continuously attack their opponent from the sides using their respective martial arts, before simultaneously kicking them away.
