            <p>Hellish Blizzard (地獄のフブキ, Jigoku no Fubuki), is a woman with short dark green hair and the top-ranking member of the B-Class heroes. She is in charge of a large faction (over 30 people)Vol. 10 bonus within the Hero Association called the Blizzard Bunch. As an esper, she uses an "inborn psychic ability to defeat monsters". Her older sister is Tornado.Vol. 3 bonus She is notorious for recruiting members for her group, but while she appears confident and calm on the surface, she is actually very insecure and frustrated from living in the shadow of her older sister. When she was offered a chance to enter A-Class, she refused as she would have a much harder chance to advance there, and instead recruited others in B-Class believing their collective strength would help her.Ch. 45 When the Monster Association launches an initial attack, she finds herself having to defend against her own Blizzard Bunch who were enslaved by a dominatrix-like monster. She overcomes being mind-controlled and fends them off with help from Tornado, causing the monster to retreat.

            <p>Fubuki is a young woman with a tall, slim, and curvaceous figure. She has chin-length, dark green hair styled into a bob, and her eyes are light green. Her main attire consists of a long white fur coat, a dark green form-fitting dress, thigh-high black boots and several necklaces. Occasionally, she wears other outfits.</p>

            <p><b>Expert Psychic Combatant:</b> Fubuki has been shown to mainly use her psychokinesis when engaged in combat, using graceful but also destructive techniques which include throwing rocks, pebbles, and various other items at her target. With agile movement thanks to her power of flight, coupled with quick thinking for improvisation, Fubuki is also able to manipulate her surroundings to her advantage to impede or crush enemies. A blue, glowing aura surrounding her body is generated whenever she uses her powers. Despite her experience, she still lacks some control over her strength. There have been a couple instances where she worries that she might have overdone her attacks.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><p> <b>Hell Storm</b> (地獄嵐, Jigoku Arashi): Fubuki’s signature move. This involves her surrounding the target with a strong tornado, drawing in rocks and nearby small objects to inflict damage along with the wind.</p>

              <li><p> <b>Psychic Binding</b> (念動金縛り, Nen-dō Kanashibari): An ability used to immobilise enemies. Fubuki has attempted to use the move on Tatsumaki to prevent her from returning to fight. However, Tatsumaki could easily free herself within seconds.</p></li>
