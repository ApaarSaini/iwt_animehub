            <p>The Deep Sea King (深海王, Shinkaiō) is the self-proclaimed leader of the Clan of the Seafolk (海人族, Kaijin-zoku). He is a large, muscular piscine humanoid adorned with a crown and a royal cape. He easily defeats Stinger and Lightning Max, and is hardly bothered by Puri-Puri Prisoner. While strong on dry land, being hydrated enables the Deep Sea King to assume his true appearance and power. He can project corrosive spit and unleash a moray tongue that has a little mouth at its end.Web ch. 24-27, Ch. 24-25 In the anime, he is voiced by Rikiya Koyama in Japanese,[12] and by Keith Silverstein in English.

            <hr>
            <p>In his dry form, the Deep Sea King was the most humanoid of all the Seafolk. He was a large, muscular being with dark-green skin on his arms, legs, and back and light skin on his chest and abdomen. He had sharp eyes, large fangs, and fins protruding from either side of his head. In place of eyebrows were small pink ovals. His attire consisted of a red speedo, an ornate crown, and a large fur-trimmed cape fastened in front with a fish-head-shaped clasp. He had heart nipples.</p>
            <p>The Deep Sea King's hydrated form was much larger and imposing. He developed a dorsal fin running the length of his back and grew fins on his forearms and shoulders, and the fins on the side of his face grew larger. His skin turned aquamarine, and his face lost its humanoid appearance and became larger and more monstrous.</p>

            <hr>
            <p><b>Expert Hand-to-Hand Combatant:</b> The Deep Sea King was shown to be a very skilled combatant capable of defeating two S-Class heroes, and seemed to have lots of combat experience, as seen when he lectured Puri-Puri Prisoner on how to fight properly, by putting much more effort into attacking an opponent with more intent to kill. He also seemed to have a preference for combo attacks, attacking his opponents mostly with a barrage of punches.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p><b>Barrage</b> (連打, Renda): Deep Sea King unleashes multiple underhand punches into his opponent. Each punch is powerful enough to leave marks in Puri-Puri Prisoner's body. It was used against Puri-Puri Prisoner.</p>
