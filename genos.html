             <p>Genos is a mechanical cyborg of average human height. His face and ears look like that of a normal human, made of artificial skin material, and his eyes have black sclera with yellow irises. He has spiky blond hair and his eyebrows are blond (brown in the anime). He also has pierced ears. Genos's wardrobe consists of street clothes with all of his upper-body attire being sleeveless as to allow his arms to transform without hassle. He has many different sets of arms, with varying abilities and strengths. Notable examples of his various "arms" are those he used in his sparring match against Saitama[3] and the arms he equipped to combat the meteor[4]. Sometimes the arm sets he uses create a metal framing around his face, like when utilizing Arms Mode and in his Monster Association Arc Upgrade.</p>

             <p><b>Expert Hand-to-Hand Combatant:</b> Thanks to his cyborg physiology and experience, Genos is one of the most proficient fighters in the series. Genos can utilize his various enhancements to distract opponents and calculate how powerful they are, as well the exact amount of power he'll need for battle and, as the series goes on, Genos improves his skills and capabilities as a cyborg. He makes use of a large variety of weaponry and upgrades in battle and is a very capable fighter in both close quarters and long-range fighting. He is skilled enough in hand-to-hand combat to fight the likes of Speed-o'-Sound Sonic[79] and Deep Sea King, even at a disadvantage, he could fight on par with the latter for a short time despite having just one arm.[80] However, he's still not a match for other extremely skilled fighters such as Bang or Garou.</p>
             <ul>
               <li><p><b>Incineration Cannon</b> (焼却砲, Shōkyaku-hō): Genos launches a concentrated beam of fire to rapidly heat up a target to the point of being able to melt various metals. It was first used against Mosquito Girl.</p>

                 <ul><li><p><b>Maximum Gauge Incineration Cannon</b> (最大出力焼却砲, Saidai Shutsuryoku Shōkyaku-hō): A variation of Incineration Cannon where Genos uses more energy than usual. It was first used against Saitama.</p></li></ul>
               <li>
                 <p><b>Spiral Incineration Cannon</b> (螺旋焼却砲, Rasen Shōkyaku-hō): An improved version of Genos's Incineration Cannon with the upgraded version of Genos's original incineration cannons received after the Super Fight Arc. It was first used against Phoenix Man but is blocked by Elder Centipede.[82] The attack is strong enough to damage Senior Centipede's carapace.</p>

               </li>
                 <ul>
                   <li><p><b>Super Spiral Incineration Cannon</b> (超螺旋焼却砲, Chō Rasen Shōkyaku-hō, Viz: Ultra Spiral Incineration Cannon): A variation of Spiral Incineration Cannon where Genos uses more energy than usual by firing the incinerating blast directly from the core. First used against Elder Centipede.[84] The attack was capable of burning Elder Centipede's insides, making him molt, though it wasn't sufficient enough to permanently end Elder Centipede's life. </p></li>
                   <li><p> <b>True Spiral Incineration Cannon</b> (真螺旋焼却砲, Shin Rasen Shōkyaku-hō): A variation of Spiral Incineration Cannon when Genos is utilizing his ten second time limit. The blast was capable of matching and completely negating one of the strongest energy attacks from the fusion of Psykos and Orochi. However, this was a one-use attack and Genos was overheating dangerously after using it. </p></li>
