            <p>King (キング, Kingu), ranked 7 at the time of the S-class meeting, is a hero with large claw-scars down the left side of his face.Ch. 30 Genos believes that he is the strongest man on the planet and that the other S-class members show him great respect.Ch. 32 In actuality, he is an ordinary 29-year-old otaku lacking superpowers and loves playing dating sims and fighting games. When King was younger, he was attacked by a Tiger-level monster which clawed his face. But when a younger Saitama defeated it, King was given credit, due to Saitama's lack of registration with the Hero Association. Other similar "victories" depicted show that Saitama and other circumstances cause high-level demons to die near him, and he often receives all the credit. As a result, he was placed in S-Class. King did not protest due to the S-Class perks and wealth, soon becoming one of the most popular heroes. King is often targeted by monsters and assassins; however, due to his luck, his enemies overestimate him and end up running away because of his presence. People have given his special technique a nickname, the "King Engine", which in actuality is his heart beating so loudly and quickly that enemies are scared away. Although Saitama knows of King's lack of abilities, he does not mind giving King the credit, instead, encouraging King to keep inspiring people as an S-Class hero. King and Saitama become friends and often visit each other to play video games. As he was present during Saitama's past life when the latter saved his life, King is the only person who remembers when Saitama had hair, prior to the latter acquiring his powers at the cost of baldness.

            <hr>
            <p><b>King Style</b> (キング流, Kingu-ryū): While his intimidating appearance and presence usually scares off potential opponents, King has to rely on this style if his opponents aren't scared and are still ready to fight. It is not a fighting style in the traditional sense. King mostly bluffs himself out of battles or just runs away. King is highly skilled in bluffing, which makes his opponents think he is formidable, sometimes even rendering them unable to perform techniques against him. His frightening aura was so powerful, King managed to literally scare a monster to death.
