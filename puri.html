            <hr>
            <p><b>Puri-Puri Prisoner Angel</b> ☆ Style (ぷりぷりプリズナー エンジェル☆スタイル, Puripuri Purizunā Enjeru ☆ Sutairu): Puri-Puri Prisoner increases his body's muscle mass, increasing his already impressive strength to new heights in a process he calls "transforming". This causes all of his clothes to tear. Puri-Puri Prisoner usually relies on his raw strength and skill in close quarters combat, when fighting in this particular style. As opposed to the likes of Superalloy Darkshine and Tanktop Master who use their brute strength to defeat their enemies in a one powerful blow such as a punch or tackle, Puri-Puri Prisoner tends to use his brute strength to defeat his enemies in a flurry or barrage of punches.
