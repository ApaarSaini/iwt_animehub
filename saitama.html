            <p>The title character, Saitama (サイタマ), is a bald-headed 25-year-old man who is bored of fighting because he is effortlessly able to defeat enemies with a single punch.Vol. 1 He lives in an apartment in City Z. Three years prior to the start of the series, when he still had hair, Saitama was job hunting when he defeated the powerful supervillain Crablante that attempted to kill a child with his buttocks on his chin. Ch. 2 Saitama says he became a hero "for the fun of it".Ch. 5 His abilities mainly consist of physical abilities magnified to an immeasurable degree: strength is the true power of Saitama, with speed, stamina, and durability being mere side powers. He attributes this to a daily training regimen (100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats, a 10 km run, eating healthy food, and not using the air conditioner or heater to reinforce his mental fortitude).(He also mentions training even when his body was wounded and made strange cracking sounds). However, he seems to become stronger when he pushes himself to his limits (three years of that transformed him into what he is today)Ch. 11 Early in the series, he picks up a disciple and roommate Genos.</p>
            <p>Though he had broken all the physical records in the Hero entrance exam by huge margins, Saitama enters the Hero Association with a score of 71, giving him one of the lowest ranks in the Hero Association. This is due to his miserable performance on the mental exam.Web ch. 16-17, Ch. 16 He soon goes up the ranks by performing many deeds, although many of his efforts are not recognized because of collateral damage or higher-tiered superheroes receiving more credit. These include defeating the raging ninja supervillain/assassin known as Speed-o’-Sound Sonic and destroying a meteor similar to the meteor that made the dinosaurs go extinct with a single punch. As of the current arc of the webcomic by ONE, he is A-Class rank 39. He does not mind letting others have the recognition though, as demonstrated in his actions following the fight against the Deep Sea King. In the Dark Matter Thieves' story arc, he is unfazed by the telekinesis of a powerful esper, further displaying his resistance. This arc was also one of the only times he has used his "serious punch", defeating the world-conquering leader of the aliens, Lord Boros, before he could use his Roaring Star Cannon attack. Through various circumstances, he forms friendships with Mumen Rider, Bang, King, Genos, and Blizzard. His superhero name in the association is Bald Cape (ハゲマント, Hagemanto, Anime: Caped Baldy).</p>

            <p>Saitama is an ordinary-looking bald man with a thin but well-built physique and is of average height and weight. He used to have a full head of short black hair but lost it due to the intensity of his hero training regimen.</p>
            <p>Saitama is usually deliberately drawn in a more simplistic style than the other characters, similar to the style of the original webcomic, with an elliptical head and simple facial features. When drawn in a more serious style, Saitama is revealed to have sharp facial features, fearsome eyes, and chiseled musculature. His posture changes as well, with a slack posture and sloping shoulders when lax, and a straightened posture and squared shoulders when serious.</p>

          <ul>
            <p><b>Normal Series:</b> Saitama's Normal Series consists of techniques in which he puts very little effort into attacking. Even though his attacks are loose in this style, most opponents tend to be finished off easily due to Saitama's tremendous strength and speed.</p>
            <li><p><b>Normal Punch</b> (普通のパンチ, Futsū no Panchi): Saitama punches his opponent. Even though Saitama puts very little to no effort into his punch, it is still strong enough to kill almost every opponent, including Dragon-Level threats, blowing apart their bodies, crushing their skulls and bones or even beheading them. When facing humans however, Saitama holds back greatly, only using enough strength to knock them out.</li></p>
            <li><p><b>Consecutive Normal Punches</b> (連続普通のパンチ, Renzoku Futsū no Panchi): Saitama launches a volley of quick, single-handed punches from his right hand. These blows are powerful enough to blow strong or large body types apart into pieces.[92] Boros was only able to survive this attack using his intense regenerative abilities.</p>
              <br><img height="250"src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/onepunchman/images/f/f8/Saitama_uses_Consecutive_Normal_Punches_on_Boros.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20191130192833" alt=""></li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <p><b>Serious Series:</b> (必殺マジシリーズ, Hissatsu Majishirīzu): In Serious Series, Saitama still attacks without putting in much effort. But Saitama's face looks more serious when he performs Serious Series attacks. Saitama does not actually consider these moves to be anything special.</p>

            <li><p><b>Serious Side Hops</b> (マジ反復横とび, Maji Hanpukuyokotobi; Viz: Serious Sideways Jumps): Saitama rapidly hops from side to side, creating a wall of afterimages. He is able to walk forward while doing so, and the shock waves caused by it were enough to easily render unconscious Speed-o'-Sound Sonic, even with his 10 afterimages.</p>
              <br><img height="250"src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/onepunchman/images/2/2c/Serious_Side_Hops.gif/revision/latest?cb=20200309023155" alt=""></li>
            <li><p><b>Serious Punch</b> (マジ殴り, Maji Naguri): Saitama throws an extremely powerful punch. The full extent of this attack is unknown, as it has never directly hit an opponent. It was so powerful that it completely negated Boros's Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon, a beam capable of wiping out an entire planet.[96] The shock wave from the punch alone was powerful enough to part the clouds on a global scale, as well as deliver the final fatal blow to Boros. The dying Boros also declared that Saitama's fatal attack on him was not even anywhere near Saitama's true power and that Saitama was still holding back.[97] Saitama also used this move to completely annihilate and disintegrate Elder Centipede, a Dragon-level threat and one of the biggest monsters in the series.</p>
