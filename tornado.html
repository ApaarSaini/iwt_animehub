            <p>Tatsumaki is a petite woman, commonly mistaken for being much younger than she really is. She has an adolescent face with emerald green eyes, and green hair that naturally curls up on the ends.[7] She wears a form-fitting black dress with long sleeves, and four high-cut leg slits that show off her legs and low-heeled black shoes. She is occasionally drawn in ONE's simplistic webcomic style.</p>

            <p><b>Master Psychic Combatant:</b> As the most powerful esper in the series, Tatsumaki possesses extreme skill in wielding her psychic abilities, whether it be for offense, defense, or miscellaneous uses. Her knowledge about psychic powers is also as vast as her skill in wielding them. Instead of relying purely in brute force, Tatsumaki has demonstrated the ability to strategize by creating a dummy of herself to distract Psykos while flying discretely beneath Psykos to target a weak point.

            <p>Immense Speed and Reflexes: Tatsumaki was fast enough to react to and save the other S-Class heroes from multiple missiles fired from Boros's spaceship.[32] She was also able to dodge multiple energy attacks from the fusion of Psykos and Orochi, an extremely powerful monster that can shoot energy beams that can cut through the Earth's surface in seconds.
